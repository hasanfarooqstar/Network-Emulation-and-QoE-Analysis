# üöÄ How to Run the Project

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the project:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

First, install all required Node.js packages by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
````

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, start the application with:

```bash
npm run
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Simulate Network Conditions

To simulate network conditions, run the network emulation script:

```bash
node network.js
```

Alternatively, to simulate Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics, run the following:

```bash
node emulate.js
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor QoE Metrics

After starting playback, open your browser‚Äôs Developer Tools:

- **Windows/Linux**: Press `CTRL + SHIFT + I`
- **Mac**: Press `CMD + OPTION + I`

Navigate to the **Console** tab to view the logged QoE metrics such as:

- Startup delay
- Buffering events
- Bitrate switches

By following these steps, you‚Äôll successfully set up, run, and monitor the project. üéâ

Happy coding! üòé

# üì° Assignment 4: Adaptive Streaming with Network Emulation and QoE Analysis

This repository contains the implementation and results of **Assignment 4**, which is part of a series of assignments focusing on multimedia streaming and adaptive streaming techniques. The project integrates network emulation tools to simulate varying bandwidth conditions and evaluates their effect on adaptive streaming and the end-user‚Äôs Quality of Experience (QoE). üöÄ

---

## üìù Project Description

Building on the foundations from **Assignments 1‚Äì3**, this assignment aims to:

1. **Integrate Network Emulation**: Use tools like `dummynet`, `wondershaper`, `mininet`, or `mahimahi` to simulate different bandwidth conditions based on predefined bandwidth traces. These traces could be either synthetic or real (e.g., traces from mobile networks).
2. **Demonstrate Adaptive Streaming**: Showcase the impact of bandwidth variations on adaptive streaming systems using the MPEG-DASH protocol.
3. **Measure QoE Metrics**: Identify and collect various metrics impacting QoE (e.g., video stalling, resolution changes, startup delay). Calculate a combined QoE metric using ITU-T P.1203 or ITU-T P.1204 standards.
4. **Document Results**: Analyze the findings and results, focusing on the QoE under different bandwidth scenarios.

## üìö Background

This assignment builds upon the work from earlier assignments:

### **Assignment 1: Video Encoding**
- Encoded video test sequences using codecs like AVC, HEVC, VP9, AV1, and VVC.
- Evaluated encoding time and quality using metrics like PSNR and VMAF.
- Defined a bitrate ladder for encoding configurations.

### **Assignment 2: Progressive Download**
- Created a simple website to enable progressive download of encoded test sequences.
- Tested video playback under varying network conditions using browser developer tools for bandwidth throttling.

### **Assignment 3: Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (MPEG-DASH)**
- Produced DASH manifests (MPD files) for the encoded test sequences.
- Integrated a DASH client (e.g., `dash.js` or `shaka-player`) with the website to enable dynamic adaptive streaming.
- Tested DASH playback under different network conditions and documented results.

## üìä Project Workflow

### **Step 1: Network Emulation**
- Select a network emulation tool (e.g., dummynet, mahimahi).
- Define or collect bandwidth traces (e.g., real-world traces from mobile networks).
- Simulate bandwidth conditions during video playback.

### **Step 2: Adaptive Streaming**
- Use the MPEG-DASH setup from **Assignment 3**.
- Play back video content using a DASH client under different emulated network conditions.

### **Step 3: Collect QoE Metrics**
- Collect metrics such as:
  - Video stalling events
  - Startup delay
  - Video resolution changes
- Calculate a combined QoE metric using ITU-T standards.

### **Step 4: Analyze Results**
- Compare QoE results across different network conditions.
- Visualize the impact of adaptive streaming on the end-user‚Äôs experience.

## üìà Results and Findings

### QoE Metrics Observed:
- **Startup Delay**: Measured the time it takes for the video to start playback under different network conditions.
- **Stalling Events**: Recorded the number and duration of playback interruptions caused by bandwidth throttling.
- **Resolution Switching**: Analyzed the frequency and smoothness of video resolution changes during playback.

### **Sample Results**:
| Metric                | Network Condition (Trace) | QoE Score (ITU-T P.1203) |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Startup Delay         | Mobile (3G)              | 80/100                  |
| Stalling Events       | LTE (4G)                 | 90/100                  |
| Resolution Switching  | Wi-Fi (High Bandwidth)   | 95/100                  |
